Designed an end-to-end interactive dashboard to analyze Sales, Profit %, Geo Performance, Product Insights, and Salesperson Metrics for a chocolate company dataset.

🔍 What’s inside the dashboard:
✔ KPI cards for Sales, Boxes, Shipments & Profit
✔ CY vs PY trend analysis
✔ Geo-wise Profit breakdown
✔ Top Products & Top Salespersons
✔ Salesperson performance matrix across countries
✔ Month-wise Profit trend
✔ Clean layout with custom theme & DAX measures

This project helped me strengthen:
 🔹 Power Query (data cleaning & modeling)
 🔹 DAX (Profit %, YoY, KPIs, aggregations)
 🔹 Dashboard UX design
 🔹 Interactive visuals & slicers

📊 Key insights identified:
➡ India leads with the highest profit contribution
➡ Few products consistently generate negative profit %
➡ Strong performers among salespersons show stable margins over time
